## Summary
As we can see, there is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews of apparel in the Vine Program since the 5 star percentage is lower in the Vine Program. Another analysis we could do for this is to find the average review in both programs. For example, just because the 5 star percentage is lower in the Vine Program, that does not necessarily mean that the average review is lower.
